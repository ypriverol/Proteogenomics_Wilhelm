# Proteogenomics_Wilhelm

Focus on files starting with 4.


The file 0_Pipeline.R creates a knitr report from all other files in this repository.

Other files that start with a "0" are old files that try to reproduce the origin results in the publication and explore effects of variability and missing values on the result.

# Trying different ways of prediction:

1_ are preping data for prediction; here only the genes are used where there are no missing values in mRNA or protein!

2_ are making predictions

3_ are evaluating predictions

-------

4_ Summary of the results to make figures for a potential publication. Here, all genes are used, as it was originally done by Wilhelm et al. Effects of missing values and variability are also examined.
