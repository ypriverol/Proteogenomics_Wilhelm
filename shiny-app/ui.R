              levels remains remarkably conserved across tissues for any
              given gene (at steady state).
              Therefore, they have proposed using the median ratio of protein to
              mRNA levels as a proxy of the gene-specific translation rate
              constant to predict protein abundance, i.e.,

              $$\\hat{\\text{protein}}_{gt} = \\hat{r}_g \\cdot \\text{mRNA}_{gt},$$

              We also note that given the simplicity of the predicted model (constant*mRNA), within genes, these correlations are equivalent to 
              the correlation between mRNA and protein levels, showing that Wilhelm et al.'s method are not adding any information to that

              we show the scatter plots of the measured mRNA versus protein levels,
              as well as Wilhelm et al.'s protein predictions (using the estimated translation rate and mRNA levels)
              versus the observed protein values for each gene. It is interesting to see that Wilhelm el al.'s predictions are just a rescaled of the mRNA levels.
